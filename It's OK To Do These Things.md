# It's OK to…

say “I don’t know”

ask for more clarity

stay at home when you feel ill

go into the office on work from home day

say that you don’t understand

ask what acronyms stand for

forget things

introduce yourself to anyone

depend on the team

ask for help

not know everything

have quiet days to think, ponder, and focus

have loud days to talk, joke, and laugh

put your headphones on

say “No” when you’re too busy

make mistakes

sing

sigh

not check your email after hours

not check your email constantly during hours

work late when you have a eureka moment

start work late because you were up late implementing an idea

just Slack it

walk over and ask someone face-to-face

meet up during the day for coffee

turn off video when you're having a really bad hair day

go somewhere else to concentrate

offer respectful feedback on other peoples’ work

challenge things you’re not comfortable with

say yes when anyone proposes a coffee or bubble tea run

say no when you don't want to go, for any reason

prefer hot chocolate

prefer tea

prefer non-alcoholic beverages, for any reason

snack

have a messy desk

have a clean desk

not want a desk

work how you like to work

ask the management how to fix it

suggest how to fix it

have off-days

have days off
