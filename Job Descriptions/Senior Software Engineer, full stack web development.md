You own the implementation of a cloud-based remote agent administration system and you will contribute to the on-premises software that it administers.

You'll need to be comfortable 

* implementing a usable and attractive web-based user interface backed by research via user testing and other UX practices, 
* challenging architectural design decisions,
* tweaking the performance of the high-velocity status endpoint where minutes down means potential data loss,
* being on-call regularly while also being the person of last resort when you are not on-call,
* teaching everything you know to junior engineers and senior engineers alike,

We expect familiarity with:

* JVM in production, especially applications written in Scala or Java
* JavaScript
* Functional programming
* Modern build tools such as SBT and Gradle
* Unit, integration, and regression testing
* Deploying and maintaining web applications to AWS

We'd love a candidate with familiarity with:

* Remote work best practices
* SEI architectural strategies
* Command and control strategies
* Reactive programming
* Pair programming
* "Agile" development
* Single language convergence, e.g. same code running on server and in browser
* Working in a HIPPA-regulated environment

Things you could be interested in:

* Rust programming language
* Scala Native
* Using the right technology even if it's an old technology
* Taking risks to use new technology
* Managing people eventually

### Team details

For each position:

#### Travel and homebase expectations

* This position is targeted for the Greater Pittsburgh area. 
* This position and all positions on this particular team are considered **remote positions** but do have an expectation of group office hours at least one day per week.
    * Applicants are expected to reside within tolerable commute distance of our office. 
        * What constitutes *"tolerable"* is up to you, butâ€¦
        * We consider *"tolerable"* to be a distance that you could travel if your presence was required in the office every day for an extended period of time.
    * Our temporary office is seconds off of XXXXXXXXX
    * We are moving to XXXXXXXXX seconds off of XXXXX and the XXX bus route, scheduled for opening in XXXXXXX.
* Infrequent travel to other offices and to conferences may be required.

#### Tech stack

As a new team within the company, our technologies are not yet established. Those on the team lean toward JVM languages, especially Scala. We're open-minded and consider the right tool for the job based on its merits while considering its popularity, ease of hiring, and room for contributions to the state of the art in the ecosystem.

We consider these technologies, languages, frameworks, etc. to be a part of our potential stack: 

* Scala ecosystem (Play!, Akka, Scalatra, Socko, Scala.js)
* Rust ecosystem (Tokio, Cargo) 
* Vue.js
* WebSockets
* PGP and GPG 

Other things we'll be working with include Amazon Web Services, Apache Nifi, Apache Beam, Atlassian Confluence, Atlassian JIRA, Github, and more. The software this team writes will be deployed on Microsoft Windows and a variety of Linux distributions, so experience with either or both is valuable.
