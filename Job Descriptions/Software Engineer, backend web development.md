Things you could be interested in:

* Rust programming language

## Tech Stack

We're writing on-premises software in Rust, Java, and Scala. We're writing web
apps and services in Scala and Ruby using frameworks and tools popular in those
ecosystems.

Importantly, we're open-minded and consider the right tool for the job based on
its merits while considering its popularity, ease of hiring, and room for
contributions to the state of the art in the ecosystem.

Other things we are working with include
Amazon Web Services,
Apache Mesos,
Apache NiFi,
Docker,
Atlassian Confluence and JIRA,
Github,
Travis CI,
Appveyor,
HashiCorp Terraform,
and more.

The software this team writes will be deployed on Microsoft Windows and a variety of Linux distributions, so experience with either or both is valuable.
