# Software Engineer, systems generalist

You will be working on the on-premises remote agent software while also using your development process expertise to maximize the team's developer happiness.

You'll need to be comfortable

* tweaking builds and establishing best practices
* having pager duty
* teaching everything you know to junior engineers and senior engineers alike
* debugging applications using still-in-development technology

We expect familiarity with:

* Systems programming and debugging
* Functional programming in any language
* Deploying and maintaining web applications to AWS

We'd love a candidate with familiarity with or interest in furthering knowledge of any or all of the following:

* common DevOps tools like continuous integration and deployment systems
* setting up nightly regression testing suites
* tweaking the performance of the high-velocity status endpoint where minutes down means potential data loss
* enabling anyone on the team to do production deployments of the web app or on-premises agent
* Deploying JVM software that is not necessarily a web app
* Modern build tools such as SBT and Gradle
* Scala programming language
* Windows API programming and debugging (e.g. C or C++ or Rust)
* Docker, Mesos, and other container-oriented buzzwords
* Working in a HIPAA-regulated environment

Things you could be interested in:

* Ruby on Rails web framework
* Rust programming language
* ChatOps and agent-based control systems
* Boxed hardware development

### Team-specific details

Folks presently on this team prefer development on Apple Macbook Pro laptops.
We can accomodate Microsoft Windows on XXXXXXXX's standard-issue PC laptop, as well.
Alternatively, we permit use of any Linux distribution that can comply with our security requirements.

#### Travel and homebase expectations

* This position is targeted for the Greater Pittsburgh area. Relocation is expected with reasonable assistance available.
* This position and all positions on this particular team are considered **remote positions** but do have an expectation of group office hours at least one day per week.
    * Applicants are expected to reside within tolerable commute distance of our Pittsburgh office.
        * What constitutes *"tolerable"* is up to you, butâ€¦
        * We consider *"tolerable"* to be a distance that you could travel if your presence was required in the office every day for an extended period of time.
* Our Pittsburgh-area office is in a brand-new building in XXXXXXX.
* Infrequent travel to other offices and to conferences may be required.

#### Tech stack

We're writing on-premises software in Rust, Java, and Scala. We're writing web
apps and services in Scala and Ruby using frameworks and tools popular in those
ecosystems.

Importantly, we're open-minded and consider the right tool for the job based on
its merits while considering its popularity, ease of hiring, and room for
contributions to the state of the art in the ecosystem.

Other things we are working with include
Amazon Web Services,
Apache Mesos,
Apache NiFi,
Docker,
Atlassian Confluence and JIRA,
Github,
Travis CI,
Appveyor,
HashiCorp Terraform,
and more.

The software this team writes will be deployed on Microsoft Windows and a variety of Linux distributions, so experience with either or both is valuable.
