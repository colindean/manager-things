You will grow into one of the mid-range roles as we train you. We expect much of your time will be spent polishing the on-premises software and creating a great user experience for our implementations team engineers and customers' administrators who will use the software in production.

You'll need to be comfortable

* working independently as well as pairing with experienced engineers on the task of the day,
* developing a strong remote discipline since this may be your first remote job,
* potentially spending more time in the office than the rest of the team,
* being on-call regularly,
* soaking up knowledge like a sponge,
* teaching senior engineers,
* documenting everything that you do a.k.a. showing your work,
* failing frequently and learning things from your failures,
* presenting your work for evaluation and demonstration,

We expect familiarity with:

* Object-oriented programming in at least one language
* Basic web development with HTML and CSS

We'd love a candidate with familiarity with:

* Windows programming in C or C++, not C#
* JavaScript ecosystem

Things you could be interested in:

* Java, Scala, or Rust programming languages

## Tech stack

As a new team within the company, our technologies are not yet established. Those on the team lean toward JVM languages, especially Scala. We're open-minded and consider the right tool for the job based on its merits while considering its popularity, ease of hiring, and room for contributions to the state of the art in the ecosystem.

We consider these technologies, languages, frameworks, etc. to be a part of our potential stack: 

* Scala ecosystem (Play!, Akka, Scalatra, Socko, Scala.js)
* Rust ecosystem (Tokio, Cargo) 
* Vue.js
* WebSockets
* PGP and GPG 

Other things we'll be working with include Amazon Web Services, Apache Nifi, Apache Beam, Atlassian Confluence, Atlassian JIRA, Github, and more. The software this team writes will be deployed on Microsoft Windows and a variety of Linux distributions, so experience with either or both is valuable.
