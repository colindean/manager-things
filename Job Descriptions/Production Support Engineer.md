# Production Support Engineer

As one of our first support engineers, you will have the opportunity to shape
the way that XXXXXX supports its data extraction products.

Regardless of your experience level â€“ from a veteran with impeccable "bedside"
manner, to someone early in their career and eager to be putting out fires,
you will be a member of a team, not a lone wolf or "person with the pager".

We expect much of your time will be spent addressing issues as customers file
them and working on automation, metrics, and other features to make your own
life and those of your teammates easier.

You'll need to be comfortable

* interfacing with customers who are contacting you with any level of percieved
    urgency
* working in the full stack of the application, from on-premises binaries and
    JVM applications, to small web services, to large web applications.
* working independently as well as pairing with experienced engineers to
    triage and address customer issues,
* developing theories about issue causes, exploring those theories, and
    suggesting workarounds until the root issue can be addresses
* being on-call regularly,
* improving product documentation or writing it from scratch,
* teaching senior and junior engineers things that they can do to facilitate
    support,
* soaking up knowledge like a sponge,
* documenting everything that you do a.k.a. showing your work,
* failing frequently and learning things from your failures,
* presenting your work for evaluation and demonstration,
* developing a strong remote discipline if this is your first remote job,
* contributing as an engineer to pick up slack

We expect familiarity with:

* Object-oriented programming in at least one language
* Reading lots of code for comprehension in languages with which you may not be
    immediately familiar.
* Debugging web applications, REST web services
* De-escalating situations and assuaging the fears of customers

We'd love a candidate with familiarity with:

* Debugging command-line, native Windows and Linux applications
* Debugging web apps running on the Java Virtual Machine
* Ruby, Scala, or Rust programming languages
* Amazon Web Services
* Docker, Apache Mesos, and other similar containerization systems
* Apache NiFi ecosystem

Things you could be interested in:

* HashiCorp Terraform
* Mesosphere
* PagerDuty
* Blameless retrospectives
* Leading the support team as a manager or tech lead as demand grows

## Tech stack

We're writing on-premises software in Rust, Java, and Scala. We're writing web
apps and services in Scala and Ruby using frameworks and tools popular in those
ecosystems.

Importantly, we're open-minded and consider the right tool for the job based on
its merits while considering its popularity, ease of hiring, and room for
contributions to the state of the art in the ecosystem.

Other things we are working with include
Amazon Web Services,
Apache Mesos,
Apache NiFi,
Docker,
Atlassian Confluence and JIRA,
Github,
Travis CI,
Appveyor,
HashiCorp Terraform,
and more.

The software this team writes will be deployed on Microsoft Windows and a variety of Linux distributions, so experience with either or both is valuable.
