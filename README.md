# Manager Things

A repository of references for managers, mostly of things I've created or used.

## Sources

Unless otherwise noted, these documents are original documents that I've written throughout my career
while in a position of leadership or management. Considering I've been in management of volunteers or
non-profit boards since 2002, tech lead or manager of software engineers since 2014, or a brief stint
as a newspaper editor 2005-2007 with a staff of nearly 40 student journalists and photographers, I have
accumulated a lot of things not always fit to be published and not always well-sourced at the time I
created them.

If you spot something unoriginal, call it out _politely_ in an issue so that I can cite it.
